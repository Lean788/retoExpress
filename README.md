# 2rd challenge [GeeksHubs Academy]
## _Express technical test_

In this case, it is about making an application capable of connecting to a server through Express Js. It shows a Hello World type message, as well as a message that verifies that the connection has been made correctly and to be more specific, to which port.

Does not uses a database, instead uses a simple Json file as simulation, because the purpose of this project is to understand how to build a API in Express, but is fully functional.

## Assessment Requirements
● Successful installation of dependencies (Express).
● NodeJS project initialization.
● Port assignment in an ES6 type variable (let).
● Running the application using the npm start command.
● Modification of the package.json file to set the start script.
